- [***] In-Person Payments: Support for Stripe M2 card reader. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/5844]
- [***] We introduced a new tab called "Menu", a tab in the main navigation where you can browser different sub-sections of the app: Switch Store, Settings, WooCommerce Admin, View Store and Reviews. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/5926]
- [***] Store admins can now access sites with plugins that have Jetpack Connection Package (e.g. WooCommerce Payments, Jetpack Backup) in the app. These sites do not require Jetpack-the-plugin to connect anymore. Store admins can still install Jetpack-the-plugin from the app through settings or a Jetpack banner. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/5924]
- [*] Add/Edit Product screen: Fix transient product name while adding images.[https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/5840]
