- [*] Product name field in product form - Remove scroll behaviour and increase field height to fully display long product names. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/6681]
- [*] Filter toolbar in Products list tab - Filter toolbar is pinned outside of the products list. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/6698]
- [internal] Loading screens are refactored to avoid duplicated code and a potential crash. Please quickly smoke test them to make sure that everything still works as before. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/6717]
- [*] Shipping settings - Weight and shipping package dimensions are localized based on device locale. Also, decimal point information is no longer lost upon saving a product, when using comma as a decimal separator. [https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-ios/pull/6721]
