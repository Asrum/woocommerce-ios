/// Proofs and documentation for **possible** concurrency issues that we may run into in the future.
///
/// In the future, these tests are **supposed to fail**. We want to fix these concurrency
/// issues soon.
///
/// Currently, every Yosemite `Store` creates their own `StorageType` for background saving.
/// For example, in `OrderStore` and `ProductStore`, we declare them like this:
///
/// ```
/// private lazy var sharedDerivedStorage: StorageType = {
///     return storageManager.writerDerivedStorage
/// }()
/// ```
///
/// The `writerDerivedStorage` method typically creates a child `StorageType`
/// (`NSManagedObjectContext`). These children:
///
/// - Have no idea they have siblings (derived `StorageType` in other `Stores`)
/// - Do not see a siblings' data until a `saveIfNeeded()` is executed on that sibling.
///
/// This can mean that if two or more derived `StorageTypes` do similar things, it may be
/// possible to upsert the same records, leading to duplicate data. For example, in `OrderStore`, we
/// upsert records like this:
///
/// ```
/// // Fetch an existing record. If it doesn't exist, create a new one.
/// let storageOrder = storage.loadOrder(orderID: readOnlyOrder.orderID)
///             ?? storage.insertNewObject(ofType: Storage.Order.self)
///
/// // Update the new or existing record with the newly fetched data from the API
/// storageOrder.update(with: readOnlyOrder)
/// ```
///
/// If by coincidence, the same operation happens **at the same time** with the same order on a
/// **different** derived `StorageType`, we could be inserting the same order twice. And because we
/// currently don't have unique key constraints, two records would be saved in Core Data.
///
/// ## Is it a Problem?
///
/// This is probably not a problem at the moment. We are careful with using a single `StorageType`
/// for every `Store`. It would be a problem if:
///
/// - We have `Store` instances that are not deallocated, still running and doing something
///   in the background while another newly created `Store` is doing the same thing.
/// - The app grows and we need to do complex cross-feature operations. For example, saving
///   Products and Product Categories simultaneously as a single transaction.
