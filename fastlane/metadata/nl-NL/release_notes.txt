We’re thrilled to announce that it’s now possible to edit an order from the app. Right now, you can edit or remove products, fees, shipping and change product quantity.

Sommige extensies van derden gaven product-metagegevens niet op logische wijze weer in de bestellingsgegevens. We’ve made some changes to display these custom fields for an order. We’ve also made several improvements to our payments and login flow, including the option to install Jetpack directly from the app.

Blijf ons feedback sturen – wij luisteren!
