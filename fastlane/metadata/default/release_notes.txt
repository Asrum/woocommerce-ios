You've been asking to create coupons in the app. We're happy to say we have a sneak peek ready if you want to help us test it out! Head over to settings in the app and turn on the experimental feature for Coupons. 

We've also made several improvements to product image uploads and in person payments, including the option to collect payments via cash, card or payment link, for all unpaid orders. Please continue to send us feedback - we are listening!
