You’ll notice a new tab called “Menu” in this release. We’ve moved store settings, switching between different stores, and viewing WooCommerce Admin to that screen. More functionality will appear there over the next couple of months!

This release also includes a fix for the product screen where the product’s name would revert back to the previous one if you uploaded an image. Thank you for reporting bugs – we are listening!
